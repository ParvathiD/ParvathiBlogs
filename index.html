                <p>An outstanding piece of animation. A must watch film for every group of people. A great movie with a mix up of all essential elements, theme, story, emotions, comedy, music, characters, (specially of old grandmother named 'Coco') truly wins heart. Her role in the movie is short, and she didn't talk much in the movie yet she had said everything. That's why its truly said that Music can even melt stones, which is a dialogue in the movie as well. It's a movie giving message of how important a family is. </p>

                <p>I absolutely loved this movie. The animation was flawless and the thought and genius that went in to little things like what the animals were doing behind the main character was taking centre stage. It was a lovely story too and the end was beautiful and heartwarming too. It was really funny and a great watch.If you really want to laugh harder than you must watch this amazing and cute movie.It is funny as well as adventurous. Anyone who likes animals should probably watch this movie. </p>

                <p>I really liked Zootopia for it’s story, animation, lovable characters, heart and lessons about how our world is, racism and developing ourselves as people in making our world a better place for everyone. The movie tells an emotional tale about an optimistic friendly hardworking rabbit Judy Hopps who wants to prove herself by making society a peaceful better place. In doing so she became Zootopia’s first rabbit Officer with a valedictorian degree. Everyone believed she wasn’t capable of achieving this dream so she took on a case and partnered up with a wisecracking laidback fox Nick Wilde. He may appear manipulative, cold and rude at first but he is shown to have a sweet caring side later but changed as he had grown up. In order to solve this case the two unlikely pair must learn to get along, work together and trust each other in order to successfully keep their city safe. </p>
